# STATE

**Updated:** 2026-06-06

## Project reference

- **Core value:** self-learning agent OS that fits on pc162 (1.9 GB ARM).
- **Current focus:** Phase 1 — Self-Learning Core (skill self-patching, FTS5 session search, memory reasoning).

## Current position

- **Phase:** 01 — Self-Learning Core
- **Wave:** W3 complete (12/16 plans). Next step: `/gsd:execute-phase 01` resumed from W4 (final implementation wave).
- **Status:** W3 shipped — SessionStore dual-write, `skill_manage` tool + kernel adapters + capability gate, `memory_reason` tool + KernelLlmAdapter + budget wiring. All workspace gates green.
- **Progress:** ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░ 75% (12 of 16 plans done; W4 next: 01-04 session_search, 01-09 snapshot refresh signal, 01-14 UserProfile + memory_conclude. W5 = human checkpoint.)

## Performance metrics

## Accumulated context

### Decisions made during W3 execution (2026-06-07)

- **`skill_manage` action list grew from 6 to 8** — plan 01-08 listed 7 actions (`create`, `patch`, `edit`, `delete`, `write_file`, `remove_file`, `list`); plan 01-05 had only delivered 6 mutation methods (no `delete_skill` / `remove_skill_file`). Added both as wrappers in `openfang-skills::registry` honoring `check_mutable` per the Protected/Immutable invariants. The full action set in the tool is now 7 + `list`.
- **`KernelCapabilities` sub-struct created on `KernelConfig`** — no such struct existed; added with a single field `allow_skill_mutation: bool` (default `false`). Wired into `Default` impl. `[capabilities]` is the new config section.
- **`KernelHandle::complete` does not exist; introduced `KernelLlm` trait** in `openfang-reasoning` instead — matches the trait-extension pattern from 01-05 (`AuditAppend`, `SkillEventBus`). `OpenFangKernel` implements `KernelLlm`. `openfang-runtime` gained `openfang-reasoning` as a direct dep so trait signatures can name public types. Crate DAG stays acyclic.
- **`ReasoningLlm::synthesize_with_usage` default method added** so real `TokenUsage` can flow without breaking existing test impls. The engine reads `usage.total() > 0` to pick the real-token path vs the `chars/4` coarse heuristic.
- **`kernel.skill_updated_tx: broadcast::Sender<SkillUpdated>`** is wired and emits on every mutation. The agent loop subscribes in W4 plan 01-09 — for W3 the `skill_refresh_required: true` sentinel ships as an in-band JSON field on the tool result.

### Decisions made during W2 execution (2026-06-07)

- **`create_skill` is exempt from `check_mutable`.** Plan 01-05 wrote `self.check_mutable(name, "create")?` as the first line of `create_skill`. That was safe with the stub returning `Ok(())`, but once 01-07 promoted `check_mutable` to a real `NotFound`-on-missing-skill body, every `create_skill` call would fail (the skill doesn't exist yet — that's the whole point). The 01-07 plan explicitly notes `create_skill` is mutation-by-definition and shouldn't pre-check; removed the call and restored 16 pre-existing 01-05 mutation tests.
- **`openfang-reasoning` now has `rusqlite` as a direct workspace dep** (narrow — only for the `params!` macro in BudgetTracker SQL). `openfang-kernel` gained an `openfang-reasoning` dep for the boot-time effective-config logger.
- **`engine_reason_returns_not_yet_implemented` smoke test replaced** by `engine_reason_minimal_smoke_test` — the 01-10 stub is now real per 01-11.
- **`BudgetRecord::new_now`, `monthly_budget_usd()` accessor, `format_effective_log`** added as a separately-testable BudgetTracker surface (Rule 2 — the privacy clamp + the boot-logger output now have direct tests, can't be bypassed accidentally).
- **`MR-05 success-criterion 11 vs `load_config` policy:** `ReasoningConfig` has `deny_unknown_fields` (typo IS rejected by serde), but `load_config` catches the parse error and silently degrades to `KernelConfig::default()`. So criterion 11's "hard startup failure on typo" is **NOT yet met**. Decision needed before W4 about whether to change `load_config`'s blanket-degrade policy (blast radius: every config section) or add a `[reasoning]`-specific propagation path (more surgical, inconsistent). The `TODO(GAP-012-Tier-2)` from CONCERNS.md is the relevant background.
- **Multiple clippy fixes inline**: `field_reassign_with_default` → struct-update form; useless `format!()` → raw string literal; `manual_flatten` → `.flatten()`; `manual_div_ceil` → `.div_ceil(4)`. All from new W2 code paths.

### Decisions made during W1 execution (2026-06-07)

- **rusqlite 0.31 has no `fts5` Cargo feature.** That feature only exists in rusqlite ≥0.32 and gates the Rust-side custom-tokenizer API — not the FTS5 virtual table itself. FTS5 virtual tables work today via `libsqlite3-sys` bundled build (`-DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS5`). `Cargo.toml` is unchanged from before W1 (apart from the `openfang-reasoning` workspace member addition from 01-10). FTS-01 satisfied by runtime `fts5_is_compiled_in` probe test. If any later plan needs the Rust tokenizer API, that's a separate rusqlite major bump — none of plans 01-02/03/04 need it (raw SQL is sufficient).
- **`Role::Tool` does not exist** in `openfang-types::message::Role`. Only three variants: `User|Assistant|System`. Tool results are carried as `ContentBlock::ToolResult` inside a user-role message. `role_string` covers the three real variants. Plan documents updated accordingly.
- **`openfang-memory` does not depend on `openfang-runtime::str_utils`.** Inlined a 6-line `safe_truncate` helper in `session_fts.rs` rather than introduce a cross-crate dep.
- **`serde_json::Value::Object` is `BTreeMap`-backed** in this workspace (no `preserve_order` feature). `serde_json::to_string` is byte-stable across runs for the same `Value`. `flatten_is_deterministic_across_runs` test pins this invariant.
- **`zeroize/serde` feature has too wide a blast radius** for plan 01-15 alone. Added a 10-line `zeroizing_string` serde adapter scoped to `KernelConfig.api_key` instead. Workspace-wide opt-in is a separate decision if it ever matters.
- **`SkillRegistry` hand-written `Debug` and `Clone`** because adding `Option<Arc<dyn Trait>>` fields broke `#[derive(Debug)]`. Pattern repeats anywhere we accept trait-object handles.
- **`SkillRegistry::list_all()` added** alongside spec'd `list()`. `list()` filters on enabled-ness (mutation surface needs this); `list_all()` is the explicit dashboard accessor when "show disabled" is needed.
- **`ReasoningEngine.memory` field marked `#[allow(dead_code)]`** in 01-10 because the field is held for plan 01-11's dispatch body. Doc comment explains why. `has_llm()` accessor added so tests don't reach into private fields.

### Decisions made during planning (2026-06-06)

- **`SkillManifest` lives in `crates/openfang-skills/src/lib.rs`**, not `manifest.rs` — the design's path reference was wrong. Plan 01-06 explicitly handles this.
- **`reasoning_budget` SQLite table is a v9 migration amendment from plan 01-12**, not its own migration. Two W2 plans (01-02, 01-12) touch `migrate_v9` body — coordinated by anchor comment `// === v9 amendment: reasoning_budget (plan 01-12) ===`.
- **`ToolOutcome { result, skill_refresh_required }` typed return** added by plan 01-08 to `tool_runner.rs`; plan 01-09 updates call sites in `agent_loop.rs`.
- **`KernelHandle` gains `reasoning_engine`, `budget_tracker`, `reasoning_config` accessors** in plan 01-13; plan 01-14 reuses them (must not re-add).
- **`ReasoningEngine::reason` is stubbed in plan 01-10** returning `ReasoningError::NotYetImplemented` so plan 01-11 has a real type to fill in while wave-1 ships independently.
- **Tool-runner anchor format**: `// === PHASE 1 PLAN 01-NN <tool_name> ===` / `// === END PHASE 1 PLAN 01-NN ===` per plan, separate `=== schema ===` block for the JSON schema list entry. Gives 2 disjoint anchor pairs per plan in `tool_runner.rs` so parallel-wave plans don't merge-conflict.
- **`ReasoningLlm` is implemented by `KernelLlmAdapter`** in plan 01-13 wrapping a `Weak<KH>` — no cycles, no new HTTP client, reuses the agent's existing LLM provider via `KernelHandle`.

### Original decisions (carryover)

- **Fork over port.** OpenFang is extended, Hermes is not ported. (`docs/chaitex/hermes-on-pc162-rust-port.md`)
- **No new database.** SQLite + bundled FTS5 only.
- **No new runtime crate for skill patching.** Extend `openfang-skills` in place.
- **New crate for reasoning.** `openfang-reasoning` to keep memory crate boundaries clean.
- **Reasoning reuses agent's LLM via KernelHandle.** No second LLM driver/config.
- **Mid-turn skill mutation visibility:** snapshot-refresh-on-mutation-signal (addendum § B.1 option 2).
- **Sessions stay msgpack BLOB on read path.** FTS5 is added via a parallel flat table populated by dual-write (addendum § A.2).
- **Protected/mutable defaults from code, not build scripts.** `SYSTEM_SKILLS` array in `SkillRegistry::load_bundled` (addendum § B.4).
- **Profile auto-update is opt-in.** `reasoning.auto_update_profile = false` by default (addendum § C.1).
- **`[reasoning]` section uses `deny_unknown_fields`.** Closes silent-default trap noted in `.planning/codebase/CONCERNS.md`.

### Todos (not yet planned)

- Tool dispatch refactor to `Tool` trait — explicitly out of scope for Phase 1, candidate for Phase 1.5 or Phase 2.
- Connection-pool migration (`r2d2_sqlite`) to relieve `Arc<Mutex<Connection>>` contention — measure first.
- Stream-based FTS5 backfill (incremental) for very large existing databases — only if profiling shows naive backfill is too slow on pc162.

### Blockers

None.

  - **01-09** snapshot refresh signal — agent loop subscribes to `kernel.skill_updated_tx` broadcast and consumes the `skill_refresh_required: true` JSON sentinel from skill_manage tool results; promotes typed `ToolOutcome` at call sites in `agent_loop.rs`.
  - **01-14** UserProfile struct + `memory_conclude` tool — reuses `KernelHandle::reasoning_engine/budget_tracker/reasoning_config` accessors added in 01-13 (do not redeclare).
  - **01-16** human-verify checkpoint (W5) — exercises all four new tools end-to-end against a live daemon per CLAUDE.md.
