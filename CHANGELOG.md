## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Schema v9: FTS5 session search via new `session_messages` flat companion table + external-content FTS5 index. The msgpack BLOB read path in `SessionStore::get_session` is unchanged — the flat table is a search-only companion. Existing v8 user databases auto-upgrade and are best-effort backfilled on first boot.
- New crate `openfang-reasoning` providing a 5-level reasoning engine (`Minimal`, `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Max`), persistent monthly budget tracker, and opt-in user-profile writeback.
- Built-in tools: `session_search`, `skill_manage`, `memory_reason`, `memory_conclude`. (Tool count increased by 4.)
- Skill self-patching with a two-tier `protected`/`mutable` defense. Defaults are applied at load time — bundled `skill.toml` files on disk are NOT mutated by a build script.
- Capability flag `capabilities.allow_skill_mutation` (default `false`; on in `Continuous`/`Proactive` modes) gates `skill_manage` mutations.
- `[reasoning]` config block with `deny_unknown_fields` — typos in this section are now detected by serde. The loaded reasoning config is logged at INFO with an explicit `(from config)` vs `(DEFAULT — no [reasoning] section)` marker.
- **Loud-degrade config policy** (closes long-standing `GAP-012-Tier-2` footgun). `crates/openfang-kernel/src/config.rs` adds `ConfigStatus::{Ok, Degraded}` and `load_config_with_status(...) -> LoadResult`. When a config file is present but fails to read/parse/deserialize, the kernel emits an **ERROR-level** log + stderr banner, populates `kernel.config_status = Degraded`, and continues on `KernelConfig::default()`. Status is surfaced on `GET /api/health` (`config_status: "ok" | "degraded"`) and `GET /api/health/detail` (full error + source path). Missing config file = `Ok` (defaults are intentional). The legacy `load_config(...) -> KernelConfig` shim still exists for backward compatibility.

### Changed

- Dashboard/API authentication key (`KernelConfig.api_key`) is now stored as `zeroize::Zeroizing<String>` so the secret is wiped from memory when the config drops. Existing TOML configs deserialize unchanged.
- `GET /api/health` response gains a `config_status` field (`"ok" | "degraded"`). `GET /api/health/detail` additionally returns `config_error` and `config_source` when degraded. Existing fields unchanged.

### Compatibility

- **Backward compatible.** Existing v8 user databases auto-upgrade to v9 on first boot. Existing sessions are best-effort backfilled into the new flat `session_messages` table; sessions whose msgpack blob fails to decode are logged at WARN and skipped (the migration does not abort). Existing `skill.toml` files parse unchanged — the two new flags (`mutable`, `protected`) are optional with `Option<bool>`. Existing `api_key = "..."` config keys load identically to before — the new `Zeroizing<String>` wrapping is transparent to the on-disk format.

## [0.5.10] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- Non-loopback requests with no `api_key` configured now return 401 by default. Opt out with `OPENFANG_ALLOW_NO_AUTH=1`. Fixes the B1/B2 authentication bypass from #1034.
- Agent `context.md` is re-read on every turn so external updates take effect mid-session. Opt out per agent with `cache_context = true` on the manifest. Fixes #843.
- `openfang config get default_model.base_url` now prints the configured URL instead of an empty string. Missing keys return a clear "not found" error. Fixes #905.
- `schedule_create`, `schedule_list`, and `schedule_delete` tools plus the `/api/schedules` routes now use the kernel cron scheduler, so scheduled jobs actually fire. One-shot idempotent migration imports legacy shared-memory entries at startup. Fixes #1069.
- Multimodal user messages now combine text and image blocks into a single message so the LLM sees both. Fixes #1043.

### Added

- `openfang hand config <id>` subcommand: get, set, unset, and list settings on an active hand instance. Fixes #809.
- Optional per-channel `prefix_agent_name` setting (`off` / `bracket` / `bold_bracket`). Wraps outbound agent responses so users in multi-agent channels can see which agent replied. Default is off, byte-identical to prior behavior. Fixes #980.

### Closed as invalid

- #818 and #819. Both reference a knowledge-domain API that does not exist on `main`. Filed against an unmerged feature branch (`plan/013-audit-remediation`). Close with a note to build the proposed validation and stale-timestamp surfacing into that feature when it lands.

## [0.5.9] - 2026-04-10

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Dashboard password hashing switched from SHA256 to Argon2id. Existing `password_hash` values in `config.toml` must be regenerated with `openfang auth hash-password`. Only affects users with `[auth] enabled = true`.

### Fixed

- Dashboard passwords were hashed with plain SHA256 (no salt), making them vulnerable to rainbow table and GPU-accelerated brute force attacks. Now uses Argon2id with random salts.
